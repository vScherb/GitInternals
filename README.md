# GitInternals
Git a look under the hood.

# Getting started
Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) or another LaTeX compiler which uses `pdflatex` for execution.
Make `build.sh` an executable with `chmod +x ./build.sh`.

Run `./build.sh` for a 16:9 presentation.
When both versions (16:9 and 4:3) are needed the parameter 43 can be added `./build.sh 43`.

Open the pdf with your PDF viewer e.g. `firefox ./bin/169/GitInternals.pdf` and `firefox ./bin/43/GitInternals.pdf`.

# Drawings
The images can be viewed in the [images](./images) directory.
Where a \*.drawio file is provided it can be viewed and edited at [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

The images are exported by toggling the different layers of the drawing.
Or when appropriate the images are exported by each tab of the [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) session.
